I did not provison this lake formation module because i found out it wasn't necessary.
I intially thought it was necessary becasue i read for you to query the data in data catalog via sprectrum, 
I will need it, till i provisioned provison it and everything still worked out fine.

Then i asked chatgpt why everything still worked, and it gave me the following responses.

✅ Why Redshift Spectrum Worked Without Lake Formation Module:
Redshift Spectrum can query external tables from the AWS Glue Data Catalog without needing Lake Formation, if:

Your IAM role (attached to Redshift) has the necessary Glue and S3 permissions.

The Glue Catalog tables and S3 data locations are not governed by Lake Formation, or LF is not enforcing permissions on them.

By default:

When Lake Formation is not enabled for governance (or even not used at all), Glue permissions are enough.

So if your redshift_service_role has permissions like:

glue:GetDatabase, glue:GetTable, etc.

s3:GetObject on the bucket where your data is,

then Redshift Spectrum will work just fine.

The Lake Formation module you wrote (with main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf) becomes necessary only when:

You enable Lake Formation permissions to govern access to Glue tables and S3 locations.

You need fine-grained access control (e.g. column-level access, row filtering, data masking).

You explicitly use Lake Formation's permission model, which overrides default Glue/S3 IAM-based access.

✅ So what happened in your case?
You did not enable Lake Formation governance, and you're not yet using Lake Formation's permission model.

Your IAM Redshift role already has sufficient permissions via the attached policies (AmazonS3FullAccess, AWSGlueConsoleFullAccess, etc.).

Hence, Redshift Spectrum is able to:

Connect to the Glue Catalog

Read external tables

Access S3 data

Run queries — without Lake Formation involved.
